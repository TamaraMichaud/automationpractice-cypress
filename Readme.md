1.	What led you to choose the automation framework used in the task?
* already done once in Java https://github.com/TamaraMichaud/youLend-test so no choice but Cypress!
2.	Why did you choose that framework over another?
* persisted with Cypress this time partly for the practice and mostly because it's mentioned in the spec so seemed more pertinent than java.
3.	What technical considerations did you have before starting?
* my experience is: Java = BDD, cypress/js - describe()/it().  I've only done cypress+BDD once and it took too long to try here.
4.	What was the hardest part of the task?
* cypress / async. Been praciticing too much similar stuff for interviews so my head hurts! (Would gain fluency with practice once I know what to focus on for my role)
5.	What would your next scenario be?
* I've only covered the happy-paths in example-test-TM.js, notes for the unhappy-paths are in a comment at the top - the next logical step would be to test checkout; various payment methods, valid/invalid
